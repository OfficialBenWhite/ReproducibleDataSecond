##Data Processing

Load packages
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(lubridate)
library(dplyr)
```

Next download the storm data from the NOAA Storm Database

Set the working directory, the file variable and the url.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(lubridate)
library(dplyr)
setwd("/Users/bw/RCourse/C5W3")
file <- "StormData.csv.bz2"
url <- "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2FStormData.csv.bz2"
```

Checks if file is downloaded otherwise download it.

```{r}
if(!file.exists(file)){   
    download.file(url,file, method="curl")
}
```

Use read.csv() to read the file into memory. This section is cached because it is computionally expensive. 

```{r, cache=TRUE}
stormData <- read.csv(file)
```
